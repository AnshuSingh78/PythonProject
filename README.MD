# This is a Python project Named Project.py
To implement deadline alerts in a personal task manager project, we can use Python's datetime module to calculate the time difference between the current time and the task deadline. Then, you can send notifications to the user when a task's deadline is approaching. This is showing how we can do that:

In this example:

The time_until_deadline function calculates the time difference between the current time and the deadline of a task.
The check_deadline function checks if a task's deadline is approaching (within the next 24 hours) and prints a notification if it is.
We define example tasks with deadlines.
We then periodically check the deadlines of these tasks using a loop and the time.sleep function to wait between checks.
You can integrate this code snippet into your task manager project and adapt it according to your specific requirements, such as how you store and retrieve task data, how often you want to check for deadline alerts, and how you want to deliver notifications to the user.

# Second Project Stone Paper Scissor Named Game1SPS
This code defines functions to get the user's choice, generate the computer's choice, determine the winner, and a main function to orchestrate the game. The game continues until the user chooses to quit by entering anything other than "yes" when prompted to play again.


# Thirst Project Guessing Mechanism
GueesgingMechanism.py is a Python code implementing a simple guessing mechanism for the Hangman game. This code allows the player to guess letters and provides feedback on whether the guesses are correct, incorrect, or if the letter has already been guessed.In this code:

The is_valid_guess function checks if the guess is a single letter that hasn't been guessed already.
The process_guess function adds the guess to the list of guessed letters and provides feedback on whether the guess is correct or incorrect.
The main function orchestrates the game, displaying the word with blanks, getting the player's guess, validating the guess, and processing it. The game continues until the player correctly guesses all letters in the word.
